          <h4 class="about-title">What is Reflexology</h4>
          <p class="about-text">
            Reflexology is a non-invasive complementary therapy, based on the principle that specific reflex points can identify areas
            in the body that are out of balance or not functioning properly. When gentle pressure is applied to these reflex
            points, it will induce deep relaxation and stimulate the body’s own healing mechanisms. This can help improve
            physical well-being and immunity as well as reduce stress.</p>
          <p class="about-text ">
            Reflexology is an intuitive complementary therapy. When you understand how it works, problems can be identified, energy blockages
            released and the body re-balanced.</p>
          <h4 class="about-title">The Benefits of Reflexology</h4>
          <p class="about-text">
            It is acknowledged that
            <b> 75% of all illnesses are stress related</b>. Stress compromises our immune system, making us more susceptible
            to disease and preventing our body from functioning properly. Our health depends on our body and mind working
            together in harmony. Too much stress can unbalance it. Reflexology encourages the body to return to its natural
            equilibrium and promote healing.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">

            Reflexology can:
            <ul>
              <li>Relieve the effects of stress</li>
              <li> Encourage the body to heal</li>
              <li>Strengthen the immune system</li>
              <li>Induce relaxation</li>
              <li>Improve circulation</li>
              <li>Create a feeling of well-being</li>
              <li>Help eliminate waste products from the body</li>
            </ul>
            <br/> Reflexologists do not claim to cure, diagnose or prescribe.

          <p class="about-text">
            Hello! My name is
            <strong>Amanda Lamboura</strong>, welcome to Step to Serenity. I took the decision to train as a reflexologist following
            a course of reflexology I had for a specific ailment.

          </p>
          <p class="about-text">




            I was astounded how my reflexologist was able to tell so much about me. To this day it still amazes me how intuitive this
            complementary therapy is. I studied at the
            <b>London School of Reflexology</b> , which is London’s largest reflexology school with the Principal, Louise Keet
            author of The Reflexology Bible
            <a href="https://www.learnreflexology.com/">www.learnreflexology.com</a> I am a fully qualified (Level 3 Diploma) reflexologist and a member of the Association
            of Reflexologists, I am also DBS (disclosure and barring service) checked.


          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            <b>My style of reflexology employs a gentle approach</b>. Therefore treatments are not only effective in stimulating
            self healing, but also have the added benefit of offering an intensely relaxing experience. Common problems that
            I may see in my practice can include conditions such as such
            <b>asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and headaches, </b> as well as
            <b>stress related issues</b>. I provide a professional, caring and confidential service. In doing so, I focus on
            clients' individual needs, which allows me to tailor a bespoke treatment plan to their own requirements. All
            care is continually reviewed to maximise the benefit and value of the service I provide.
