          <h4 class="about-title">What is Reflexology</h4>
          <p class="about-text">
            Reflexology is a non-invasive complementary therapy, based on the principle that specific reflex points can identify areas
            in the body that are out of balance or not functioning properly. When gentle pressure is applied to these reflex
            points, it will induce deep relaxation and stimulate the body’s own healing mechanisms. This can help improve
            physical well-being and immunity as well as reduce stress.</p>
          <p class="about-text ">
            Reflexology is an intuitive complementary therapy. When you understand how it works, problems can be identified, energy blockages
            released and the body re-balanced.</p>
          <h4 class="about-title">The Benefits of Reflexology</h4>
          <p class="about-text">
            It is acknowledged that
            <b> 75% of all illnesses are stress-related</b>. Stress compromises our immune system, making us more susceptible
            to disease and preventing our body from functioning properly. Our health depends on our body and mind working
            together in harmony. Too much stress can unbalance it. Reflexology encourages the body to return to its natural
            equilibrium and promote healing.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">

            Reflexology can:
            <ul>
              <li>Relieve the effects of stress</li>
              <li> Encourage the body to heal</li>
              <li>Strengthen the immune system</li>
              <li>Induce relaxation</li>
              <li>Improve circulation</li>
              <li>Create a feeling of well-being</li>
              <li>Help eliminate waste products from the body</li>
            </ul>
            <br/> Reflexologists do not claim to cure, diagnose or prescribe.

          <p class="about-text">
            Hello and welcome to Step to Serenity! My name is
            <strong>Amanda Lamboura</strong>. I was first inspired by reflexology after a course of treatment following ill health.
            I was amazed at how much the reflexologist could tell from touching my feet and how intuitive this complementary
            therapy is.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">


            I am a
            <b>fully qualified (level 3 diploma) reflexologist</b> and a member of the Association of Reflexologists. I studied
            at the
            <b>London School of Reflexology</b> which is London’s largest reflexology school. I am also DBS registered.





          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            <b>My style of reflexology employs a gentle approach</b>. Therefore treatments are not only effective in stimulating
            self healing, but also have the added benefit of offering an intensely relaxing experience. Common problems that
            I may see in my practice can include conditions such as such
            <b>asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and headaches, </b> as well as
            <b>stress-related issues</b>. I provide a professional, caring and confidential service. In doing so, I focus on
            clients' individual needs, which allows me to tailor a bespoke treatment plan to their own requirements. All
            care is continually reviewed to maximise the benefit and value of the service I provide.
          </p>

          <p class="about-text">I practice both from my practice in Shirley near Croydon as well as offering home visits. I offer treatments to
            clients covering a wide area including
            <b>Shirley, West Wickham, Bromley, Beckenham and Croydon</b>.

        <p class="about-text">
          Your consultation starts by taking a full medical history to determine which type of treatment plan is most suitable for
          you. You will then relax in a special reclining chair and be covered with a soft blanket. Shoes and hosiery may
          then be removed for foot reflexology. Gentle music may be played and candles lit to enhance relaxation. A small
          amount of organic cream will be applied and the treatment will begin. This is very relaxing and you may wish to
          close your eyes or even fall asleep. It is entirely up to you.
